 This method will initialize internal SDK components so that communication with the AirWatch
 console can occur.
 @param handler - The completion block takes two parameters BOOL success and NSError outError.
 @discussion success will be YES if initialization was successful, NO on failure. If an error occurs
 outError will contain an NSError object with the domain AWSDKErrorDomain, and one of the following 
 errors:
 
 AWSDKErrorServerNotSet - Thrown when the AWServer deviceServicesURL is nil.
 AWSDKErrorInitializationFailed - Thrown when an initialization step has failed.

/*!
 Used to handle the SDK URL scheme. Before the SDK will handle the URL, the scheme MUST match the 
 value stored in the sdkURLScheme property.
 
 @param url url to handle. Should be in the following format:
	<scheme>://sdkcommand/changeUID;uid=<uid>;groupid=<groupid>;serverurl=<serverurl> or
    <scheme>://sdkcommand/changeUID;cuid=<uid>;groupid=<groupid>;serverurl=<serverurl>
	where <scheme> matches the self.sdkURLScheme and one placed in the Info.plist for your app
 @param outError If an error occurs, upon return contains an NSError object that describes the 
 problem. Pass NULL if you do not want error information.
 
 @return BOOL indicating if the SDK handled the url.
 
 @discussion Please note that a return value of NO does NOT indicate an error. If an error occurs 
 outError will contain an error with the AWSDKErrorDomain and one of the following error codes:
 
 AWSDKErrorSDKSchemeNotSet - Thrown when self.sdkURLScheme is nil.
 AWSDKErrorMissingParameterInURL - Thrown when the URL passed in doesn't contain the required 
 parameters.
